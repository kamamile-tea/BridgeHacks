      2: "The U.S. is the #1 trash-producing country in the world at 1,609 pounds per person per year. This means that 5% of the world's people generate 40% of the world's waste.",
      3: "The highest point in Hamilton County, Ohio (near Cincinnati) is Mount Rumpke. It is actually a mountain of trash at the Rumpke sanitary landfill towering 1045 ft. above sea level.",
      4: "The US population discards each year 16,000,000,000 diapers, 1,600,000,000 pens, 2,000,000,000 razor blades, 220,000,000 car tires, and enough aluminum to rebuild the US commercial air fleet four times over.",
      5: "Out of every $10 spent buying things, $1 (10%) goes for packaging that is thrown away. Packaging represents about 65% of household trash.",

      7: "At Christmas, as much as 83 square kilometres of wrapping paper will end up in UK bins when it could have been recycled instead. Thatâ€™s the same size as Sunderland!",

      3: "The amount of water on Earth is constant, and continually recycled over time: some of the water you drink will have passed through a dinosaur.",
      4: "There are more than 1,200 species of bat in the world and not one of them is blind.",
      5: "40 percent of all bottled water sold in the world is bottled tap water.",
      6: "Paper can be recycled only six times. After that, the fibers are too weak to hold together.",
      7: "There is no known scientific way of predicting earthquakes. The most reliable method is to count the number of missing cats in the local paper: if it trebles, an earthquake is imminent.",
      8: "Beavers have transparent eyelids so they can see underwater with their eyes shut.",
